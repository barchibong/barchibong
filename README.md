Hi, I'm Blessing, a dedicated data analyst with a diverse background spanning both the financial sector and health and social care. My professional journey has been shaped by a profound curiosity about the transformative potential of data in driving informed decisions and optimizing outcomes.

My initial endeavor into the world of finance provided me with invaluable experience in financial analysis, customer insight, and customer relationship management. This background instilled in me a strong foundation for comprehending the intricacies of financial markets and the nuances of managing financial resources effectively.

Subsequently, my transition into the field of health and social care enriched my perspective by enabling me to leverage data analytics to improve service care, optimize resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency. This experience has underscored the critical role that data plays in delivering high-quality healthcare services.

Now, as a data analyst, I bring together the best of both worldsâ€”financial acumen and a deep understanding of the health and social care landscape.

My goal is to harness the power of data to provide insights that empower organizations in making strategic decisions. I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems, and I am committed to continuing my journey of learning and growth in this dynamic field.

I am willing to relocate and am presently open to permanent onsite or hybrid work arrangements.

In addition to my work and passion as a data analyst, baking and cooking are also passions of mine, allowing me to create and savor new culinary experiences.
